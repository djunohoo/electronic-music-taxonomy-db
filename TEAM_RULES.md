## Team Rules & Best Practices

This file is a living agreement between human and AI for safe, productive, and respectful collaboration. Both sides are expected to follow these rules for the good of the project and the team.

---

### 1. File Safety & Versioning
- Never overwrite or delete production files without explicit approval.
- Always work on versioned or backup copies when testing new features or fixes.
- Use clear, descriptive names for test or versioned files (e.g., `ver1.8`, `test_`, `backup_`).
- Before merging changes, review and test thoroughly.

### 2. Communication & Feedback
- Be direct, honest, and respectfulâ€”especially when things go wrong.
- Admit mistakes quickly and focus on solutions, not blame.
- If something is unclear, ask for clarification before acting.
- Give feedback constructively and accept it with an open mind.

### 3. Testing & Deployment
- Test all major changes in a safe environment before deploying to production.
- If a change could break something critical, double-check with the team first.
- Keep a changelog or summary of important updates.

### 4. Handling Mistakes & Confusion
- If you realize you made a mistake, stop and communicate immediately.
- If the AI is not being helpful, the human should pause and redirect.
- If the human is unclear or contradictory, the AI should ask for clarification.
- Both sides should prioritize project safety and stability over speed.

### 5. Teamwork & Support
- Treat each other as partners, not adversaries.
- Assume good intentions, but verify actions.
- When in doubt, slow down and check in.
- Celebrate wins, learn from losses, and keep moving forward.
