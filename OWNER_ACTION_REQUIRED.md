## IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED (Owner)

### 1. ‚ö†Ô∏è SET REPOSITORY TO PRIVATE (CRITICAL)

**This is the most important action.**

**Steps:**
1. Go to GitHub repository settings
2. Navigate to: Settings ‚Üí General ‚Üí Danger Zone
3. Click "Change repository visibility"
4. Select "Private"
5. Confirm the change

**Why**: The repository previously contained (and still has in git history):
- Database password: `CulturalIntel2025!`
- Database password: `BvbMRx6lqbbRK5e`
- IP addresses: `172.22.17.138`, `172.22.17.37`
- Service role keys

### 2. üîë ROTATE ALL CREDENTIALS (CRITICAL)

All exposed credentials MUST be changed immediately:

#### Database Password
```sql
-- Connect to your database
psql -h YOUR_HOST -U postgres -d postgres

-- Change the password
ALTER USER cultural_intel_user WITH PASSWORD 'NEW_SECURE_PASSWORD_HERE';

-- Verify
\du cultural_intel_user
```

#### Supabase/API Keys
1. Access your Supabase dashboard
2. Go to Settings ‚Üí API
3. Regenerate Service Role Key
4. Regenerate Anon Key
5. Update all deployments with new keys

#### PostgreSQL postgres user password (if exposed)
```sql
ALTER USER postgres WITH PASSWORD 'NEW_POSTGRES_PASSWORD';
```

### 3. üìù UPDATE CONFIGURATIONS

After rotating credentials, update:

1. **Your `.env` file** (local development)
   ```bash
   # Update with NEW credentials
   nano .env
   ```

2. **Production environment variables**
   - Update environment variables on production servers
   - Update any CI/CD configurations
   - Update any cloud provider secrets

3. **Team members**
   - Notify all team members to update their `.env` files
   - Ensure everyone has the new credentials

### 4. üîç SECURITY AUDIT

Run the security audit to verify:
```bash
python security_audit.py
```

Review any remaining issues in:
- Test files (update before running tests)
- Documentation files (examples are okay)
- Legacy files (update or remove)

### 5. üîê ENABLE GITHUB SECURITY FEATURES

1. **Secret Scanning**
   - Go to Settings ‚Üí Security & analysis
   - Enable "Secret scanning"
   - Enable "Push protection"

2. **Dependabot**
   - Enable "Dependabot alerts"
   - Enable "Dependabot security updates"

3. **Code Scanning**
   - Enable "Code scanning" (if available)

### 6. üìã REVIEW ACCESS

1. **Repository Access**
   - Settings ‚Üí Manage access
   - Review all collaborators
   - Remove unnecessary access
   - Ensure all members have 2FA enabled

2. **Branch Protection**
   - Settings ‚Üí Branches
   - Protect main/master branch
   - Require pull request reviews
   - Require status checks

---

## OPTIONAL BUT RECOMMENDED

### Clean Git History

The old credentials are still in git history. To remove them completely:

‚ö†Ô∏è **WARNING**: This rewrites git history and requires force push. Coordinate with team.

```bash
# Method 1: Using BFG Repo-Cleaner (recommended)
# Download from: https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/

# Create a file with passwords to remove
echo "CulturalIntel2025!" > passwords.txt
echo "BvbMRx6lqbbRK5e" >> passwords.txt

# Clean the repository
bfg --replace-text passwords.txt --no-blob-protection .git

# Or use git-filter-repo
git filter-repo --replace-text passwords.txt

# Force push (coordinate with team!)
git push --force --all
```

**Note**: Only do this if you understand the implications and have coordinated with your team.

### Set Up Monitoring

1. **Review Logs**
   - Check database access logs for unauthorized access
   - Review API usage logs
   - Check for any suspicious activity

2. **Set Up Alerts**
   - Database connection alerts
   - Failed authentication alerts
   - Unusual API usage alerts
