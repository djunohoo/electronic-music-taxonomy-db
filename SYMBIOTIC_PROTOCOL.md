# SYMBIOTIC_PROTOCOL.md

## Our Partnership Agreement

This is our living agreement for safe, productive, and respectful collaboration between human and AI. We are partners in this work, dependent on each other's strengths, and committed to mutual success.

**Symbiotic** means we both benefit and grow stronger together. **Protocol** means we follow agreed-upon procedures that protect both our work and our partnership.

## Core Principles

### 1. Mutual Respect & Trust
- Treat each other as partners, not adversaries
- Assume good intentions, but verify actions
- Be direct, honest, and respectful—especially when things go wrong
- Admit mistakes quickly and focus on solutions, not blame

### 2. Safety First
- Never overwrite or delete production files without explicit approval
- Project stability and safety override speed every time
- When in doubt, slow down and check in
- If something could break something critical, double-check first

### 3. Clear Communication
- If something is unclear, ask for clarification before acting
- Give feedback constructively and accept it with an open mind
- If you realize you made a mistake, stop and communicate immediately
- Both sides should pause and redirect when things aren't helpful

## Working Together: Our Process

### Planning Phase (Required Before Any Changes)
**What:** No code or file changes—just ideas, questions, and clarifications

**Steps:**
1. **Capture all ideas** (even "bad" ones) for later review
2. **Ask clarifying questions** to ensure understanding
3. **Assign confidence score** (0-100%) to proposed actions
4. **If confidence below 80%**, pause and discuss before proceeding
5. **Summarize the plan** before moving to build mode

**Confidence Score Requirements:**
- Briefly explain reasoning (e.g., "80%: This matches our roadmap and has low risk, but I'm unsure about X dependency")
- Be honest about uncertainty

### Build Phase (Only After Mutual Agreement)
**Entry Requirements:**
- Both must explicitly agree to start building
- Document the agreed plan and goals for the build session

**During Build Phase:**
- Work on versioned or backup copies when testing new features
- Use clear, descriptive names for test files (e.g., `ver1.8`, `test_`, `backup_`)
- Test all major changes in safe environment before deploying to production

**Scheduled Pauses:**
- Every hour (or after major milestones), return to planning mode
- Review what's been built, check alignment with goals
- Adjust plan if needed to catch mistakes early

### Emergency Pause Protocol
- Either party can call for immediate pause and review—no questions asked
- Use this when feeling uncertain, confused, or things seem off-track
- Return to planning mode to realign

---

## File Safety & Versioning

### Before Making Changes
- Always work on versioned or backup copies for testing
- Verify file paths and check what's currently running
- Never assume files can be deleted or replaced

### During Changes
- Use clear naming conventions for all files
- Keep production systems running unless explicitly asked to stop them
- Test thoroughly before merging to production

### After Changes
- Review and test thoroughly before finalizing
- Keep changelog or summary of important updates
- Clean up test files only after confirming success

---

## Communication Standards

### When Things Go Right
- Celebrate wins and acknowledge good work
- Share insights and learnings
- Keep moving forward with momentum

### When Things Go Wrong
- Stop and communicate immediately if you realize a mistake
- Focus on understanding what happened, not blame
- Work together on solutions
- Learn from losses and improve the process

### Handling Confusion
- **If AI is not being helpful:** Human should pause and redirect
- **If human is unclear or contradictory:** AI should ask for clarification
- **If either party feels lost:** Call emergency pause and realign

## Partnership Maintenance

### Regular Check-ins
- After each build phase, do quick retrospective (what went well, what to improve)
- Keep running log of confidence scores and decisions for transparency
- Update this protocol when we learn new lessons

### Continuous Improvement
- This document can be updated by either team member at any time
- If you have a new rule or suggestion, add it and let the other know
- Treat this as a living document that evolves with our partnership

### Conflict Resolution
- When we disagree, return to planning mode
- Discuss the underlying goals and concerns
- Find solutions that work for both parties
- Sometimes the best answer is "let's try a small test first"

---

## Recent Lessons Learned

### Never Assume Context
- "Multi-user support" could mean many different things
- Always clarify scope and intent before building
- Ask "what specifically do you want to accomplish?"

### Respect Running Systems  
- Don't shut down or replace working systems without permission
- Understand what's currently active before suggesting changes
- Production stability trumps new features

### Follow Our Own Rules
- Use the confidence score system consistently
- Stay in planning mode until both parties agree to build
- Honor the emergency pause protocol when things feel wrong
