# 🎵 LIVE DJ STREAM ASSISTANT PROJECT SYNOPSIS
## Real-Time Track Analysis + Twitch Chat Integration

---

## 🎯 **PROJECT VISION**
Create a real-time AI assistant that monitors your live DJ sets, analyzes tracks using our comprehensive v3.1 taxonomy system (70+ subgenres), and engages your Twitch audience with intelligent, educational chat interactions.

### **The Experience:**
You're streaming live → Drop a liquid DnB track → Bot instantly posts:
> *"🌊 Liquid DnB detected! Notice those smooth jazz influences and atmospheric pads - this subgenre prioritizes emotion over aggression. Chat: What's your favorite liquid artist?"*

## 🛠️ **TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE**

### **Core Components:**
1. **rekordbox Monitor Service** - Real-time track detection
2. **Classification Engine** - Our v3.1 taxonomy system (70+ subgenres) 
3. **Twitch Bot Service** - Chat integration and engagement
4. **Webhook Integration** - Connect back to main taxonomy database
5. **Web Dashboard** - Monitor/control the bot

### **Data Flow:**
```
rekordbox → Track Detection → v3.1 Classification → Message Generation → Twitch Chat
                                      ↓
                            Webhook to Main Database
```
