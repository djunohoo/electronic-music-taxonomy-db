# ⚠️ CRITICAL SECURITY WARNING ⚠️

## THIS REPOSITORY MUST BE PRIVATE

This repository contains configuration for a production electronic music taxonomy system.

## IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED

### 1. Verify Repository Privacy
- [ ] Ensure this repository is set to **PRIVATE** on GitHub
- [ ] Review who has access to this repository
- [ ] Remove any unnecessary collaborators

### 2. Credential Security
- [ ] **NEVER** commit the `.env` file
- [ ] Rotate ALL database passwords (they were previously exposed)
- [ ] Regenerate ALL API keys
- [ ] Update your local `.env` file with new credentials

### 3. Configuration Setup
```bash
# 1. Copy the example environment file
cp .env.example .env

# 2. Edit .env with YOUR credentials (not the examples!)
nano .env

# 3. Verify .env is in .gitignore
grep ".env" .gitignore

# 4. Run security audit
python security_audit.py
```

## What Was Fixed

The core system files have been updated to use environment variables instead of hardcoded credentials:

✅ Main configuration files
✅ Database setup scripts  
✅ Core documentation
✅ Shell scripts

## What Still Needs Attention

Some legacy files may contain historical IP addresses or example configurations. These are safe as examples but should be updated before production use.

Run the security audit to find them:
```bash
python security_audit.py
```

## Documentation

- **[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)** - Complete security policy and best practices
- **[SECURITY_MIGRATION.md](SECURITY_MIGRATION.md)** - Step-by-step migration guide
- **[README.md](README.md)** - Updated setup instructions

## If Credentials Were Exposed

If you believe credentials may have been exposed publicly:

1. **Immediately** change all database passwords
2. **Immediately** regenerate all API keys
3. Review access logs for unauthorized access
4. Consider rotating SSL certificates if applicable
5. Update all deployment configurations

## Support

For questions about security:
- Review [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)
- Run `python security_audit.py`
- Contact repository owner directly (do NOT create public issues about security)
