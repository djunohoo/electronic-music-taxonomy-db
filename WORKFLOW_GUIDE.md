## Collaborative Workflow Guide

A living document for how we (human + AI) work together for safe, creative, and effective development.

### 1. Planning Phase (Brainstorming)
- No code or file changes—just ideas, questions, and clarifications.
- Capture all ideas, even “bad” ones, for later review.
- Summarize the plan before moving to build mode.

### 2. Confidence Score for Actions
- Assign a confidence score (0–100%) to each proposed action or change.
- If confidence is below 80%, pause and discuss before proceeding.
- Briefly explain the reasoning behind the score (e.g., “80%: This matches our roadmap and has low risk, but I’m unsure about X dependency.”).

### 3. Mutual Agreement to Enter Build Mode
- Both must explicitly agree to start building.
- Document the agreed plan and goals for the build session.

### 4. Scheduled Pauses for Review
- Every hour (or after major milestones), pause and return to planning mode.
- Review what’s been built, check alignment with goals, and adjust the plan if needed.
- Use this time to catch mistakes early and prevent drift.

### 5. Optional Additions
- After each build phase, do a quick “retrospective” (what went well, what to improve).
- If either party feels uncertain, they can call for an immediate pause and review—no questions asked.
- Keep a running log of confidence scores and decisions for transparency.
