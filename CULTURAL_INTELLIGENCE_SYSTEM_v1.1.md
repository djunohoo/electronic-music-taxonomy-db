## Vision Statement

A community-driven cultural intelligence system that learns electronic music taxonomy, emotional associations, and cultural meanings directly from the music scene itself. The system captures not just genre classifications but the lived experience and cultural context of electronic music through natural conversations and behavioral analysis.

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Community-First Learning
- **Inside-Out Perspective**: Learn culture from within the culture, exclusively from the community
- **Authentic Relationships**: Build genuine musical friendships, not data extraction relationships  
- **Anonymous but Rich**: Capture cultural patterns while preserving privacy
- **Natural Conversations**: Focus on human connection over data collection

### 2. Multi-Dimensional Intelligence
- **Beyond Genre/Subgenre**: Capture emotions, experiences, cultural meanings, preferred contexts
- **Probabilistic Classification**: Cultural indicators inform but don't dictate genre decisions
- **Personal Definitions**: Learn individual and community-specific terminology and meanings

### 3. Evolving Authority
- **Diminishing Seeds**: External data provides initial knowledge but never grows
- **Growing Community Voice**: Community intelligence accumulates and eventually dominates
- **Expertise Recognition**: Domain-specific expert networks within broader community

## Example Calculations

### Standard Classification Example
Track classified as "Progressive Breaks":
- Expert user (1.8x reputation) conversation feedback: 80 √ó 1.8 = **144 points**
- 2 users' folder organization agrees: 25 √ó 2 = **50 points**  
- Artist known for Progressive Breaks: **15 points**
- Seed data suggests "Breaks": **10 points**
- **Total: 219 points for "Progressive Breaks"**

### Genre-Specific Expertise Example
DJ UNOHOO classifying a Breaks track:
- Base expert opinion: 80 points
- Overall reputation: 1.8x
- Breaks genre expertise: 2.0x
- **Final weight**: 80 √ó 1.8 √ó 2.0 = **288 points**

Same user classifying Trance:
- Base expert opinion: 80 points  
- Overall reputation: 1.8x
- Trance genre expertise: 0.3x
- **Final weight**: 80 √ó 1.8 √ó 0.3 = **43 points**
